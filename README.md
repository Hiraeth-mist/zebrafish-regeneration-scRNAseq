# Zebrafish Fin Regeneration — Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis 🐟🧬

This repository contains analysis workflows for single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from zebrafish fin regeneration.

## 🔬 Project Summary
In this study, we explore the regenerative response in zebrafish fins using scRNA-seq. The analysis includes:
- Data preprocessing and quality control
- Data integration across timepoints
- Gene expression visualization (focus: taf1b, rrn3, sprtn, polr1d + markers)
- Cell type annotation based on marker genes
- (Optional) Pseudotime analysis to study regeneration trajectory
